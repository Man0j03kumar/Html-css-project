        <p class="python_text">Python is a versatile and high-level programming language renowned for its readability,
            simplicity, and extensive support for integration. Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, Python has
            since gained widespread popularity across various domains, including web development, data science,
            artificial intelligence, and automation. Its syntax emphasizes code readability and allows developers to
            express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java, making it an excellent choice for
            both beginners and experienced programmers. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including
            procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

            One of Python's strengths lies in its extensive standard library, offering a wide range of modules and
            packages that simplify complex tasks, from handling regular expressions to interacting with databases. The
            language also boasts a thriving ecosystem of third-party libraries, frameworks, and tools, such as Django
            for web development, NumPy for scientific computing, and TensorFlow for machine learning.

            Python's versatility extends to its use in automation and scripting, contributing to its popularity in
            fields like DevOps and system administration. Additionally, its community-driven development model ensures
            constant improvement, and Python's open-source nature fosters collaboration and innovation.

            Overall, Python's readability, versatility, and broad community support make it a programming language of
            choice for a diverse range of applications, making it a valuable tool in the hands of developers, data
            scientists, and engineers alike.</p>

            Django is a high-level, open-source web framework for Python that enables rapid development of secure and
            maintainable websites and web applications. Initially developed by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison at the
            Lawrence Journal-World newspaper in 2003, Django follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) and "Convention
            over Configuration" (CoC) principles, promoting clean, efficient, and reusable code.
            One of Django's key features is its robust and built-in administrative interface, allowing developers to
            manage application data models effortlessly. The framework also provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
            system, enabling seamless interaction with databases without writing raw SQL queries. Django supports
            various database backends, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
